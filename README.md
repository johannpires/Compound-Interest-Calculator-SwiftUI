# Compound Interest Calculator

## Overview
Evolution of my first iOS App, now in SwiftUI. 

The Compound Interest Calculator is an iOS application designed to facilitate the computation of compound interest with monthly contributions. By harnessing the power of Swift, I have constructed this app from ground up to provide users with a seamless and efficient means of achieving accurate financial calculations.

## Purpose
This project aims to provide a user-friendly tool for calculating compound interest, enabling users to make informed financial decisions and secure their financial future. It's also intended to highlight the extraordinary power of compounding, showcasing the exponential potential of consistent contributions and reinvestment strategies.
